# Changelog

## 0.21.1

- bug fixes
  - visualizer: fix memory leak when editing; fix ignored `smooth` option

## 0.21.0

- main
  - renamed `--sync` option to `--send` (deprecation,  backward-compatible)
- widgets
  - sliders/pads: when receiving feedback while touched, the widget waits to be released before updating to the latest received value.
  - input: the widget's value is no longer validated when leaving focus by clicking somewhere else or hitting the `Tab` key (it must be submitted by hitting the `Enter` key); when submitting a value to another widget, the feedback from this widget doesn't trigger a second osc message anymore; non-editable inputs can't steal focus anymore
  - added support for `null` value in `target` option to disable osc sending
- misc
  - property fields are now parsed using [JSON5](https://github.com/json5/json5), a more flexible notation. Session files are still written in standard JSON format, this is just a way to avoid typing mistakes when using the editor.
  - remote editing also accepts JSON5 notation
